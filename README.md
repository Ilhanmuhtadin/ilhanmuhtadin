# Hi there, I'm Ilhan Muhtadin! ðŸ‘‹

ðŸŽ“ I'm a 21-year-old undergraduate student passionate about machine learning and its applications in solving real-world problems.


ðŸŒ± Currently:
- TensorFlow: Expanding my knowledge by delving deeper into neural networks and deep learning.
- Docker: Learning to containerize my applications for easy deployment and scalability
- I start learning could azure


ðŸ”­ Here are some of the things I'm working on:
- Developing predictive models for student performance using Python, sklearn and TensorFlow.
- Explore pandas, numpy data and several statistical methods for cleaning and selection feature
- Exploring data visualization techniques with libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn.
- Learning to containerize applications with Docker for easy deployment.
  

ðŸ’» Languages and Tools:
- Python: My primary language for implementing machine learning algorithms.
- Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow,Spacy.
- Database: MySQL.
- Tools: Docker, MLflow,AWS,Langchain
